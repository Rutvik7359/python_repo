- I tested out the following scenarios and output velocity vs time and height vs time graphs for them. The

- graphs recorded the height and velocities for when the slinky was released to when the top of the slinky

- passed the rest position of the bottom of the slinky:

- 2 mass, 1 spring:

- -  When held:

o  Bottom of slinky kept moving up

and down because energy is

conserved

- -  When let go:

o  The bottom of the slinky did start

to move slowly and moved faster

as the top of the slinky got closer

- 2 mass, 1 spring + damper:

- -  When held:

o  Bottom of slinky moved up and

down but slowed down with each

movement

- -  When let go:

o  The bottom of the slinky did not

move right away, but when the

top got close, it started to move,

but would slow down and allow

the top to catch up again. This was

repeated a few times.

- n mass, n-1 spring (where n = 100):

- -  When held:

o  The masses throughout the whole

slinky kept bouncing through like a

wave which resembled a real

slinky, but since there was no

damper, the waves kept going.

- -  When let go:

o  The weights would keep

accelerating and decelerating just

like a wave. The bottom of the

slinky did not start to move until

the top was close.

- n mass, n-1 spring  + damper (where n = 100):

- -  When held:

o  The masses throughout the whole

slinky kept bouncing through like a

wave which resembled a real

slinky and even came to rest like

the one in the video

- -  When let go:

o  From the graph, you can see that

the bottom of the slinky is at rest

through the whole graph. It did

not move until after the top

reached the bottom.

- In conclusion, the n mass n-1 spring + damper most closely simulated a slinky.
